# Intro to AI Notebooks

The two notebooks in this repo will help to provide an introduction to machine learning using the Keras framework. The hope is that this motivates what is going on behind the scenes when using and building models for many different kinds of tasks.
The hands_on_ML_MNIST.ipynb notebook is meant to be filled out, and provides tasks to do and hints to complete them. The hands_on_ML_MNIST_solution.ipynb has all of the tasks done already and can be run sequentially when downloaded.
